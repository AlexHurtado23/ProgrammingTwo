    "# Types of Arrays in C\n",
    "In c programming language, arrays are classified into two types. They are as follows:\n",
    "*\tOne dimensional array\n",
    "*\tMulti dimensional array\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single Dimensional Array\n",
    "In the programming language c, one-dimensional arrays are used to store a list of values of the same data type, these can be of type integer string or string.\n",
    "One-dimensional arrays are used to use one row of values.\n",
    "In a one-dimensional matrix, the data is stored linearly. One-dimensional matrices are also called one-dimensional matrices, linear matrices, or simply 1-D matrices.\n",
    "One-dimensional array declaration:\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "``` C\n",
    "int rollNumbers [60];\n",
    "char list [6];\n",
    "int numbers[50]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization of Single Dimensional Array\n",
    "We use the following general syntax for declaring and initializing a single dimensional array with size and initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` C\n",
    "int list [6] = { 9, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8 };\n",
    "```\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi Dimensional Array\n",
    "An array is called as a multidimensional array when it has more than two dimensions.\n",
    "In simple words, an array created with more than one dimension (size) is called a multidimensional array.\n",
    "The multidimensional matrix can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional or four or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most popular and commonly used multi dimensional array is two dimensional array. \n",
    "The 2-D arrays are used to store data in the form of table. We also use 2-D arrays to create mathematical matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "``` C\n",
    "int matrix_A [2][3];\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Initialization of Two Dimensional Array\n",
    "\n",
    "The following general syntax for declaring and initializing a two-dimensional array with a specified number of rows and columns with initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "``` C\n",
    "int matrix_A [2][3] = { {1, 2, 3},{4, 5, 6} } ;\n",

    "## Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text File \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Text file** is a type of *digital*, *non-executable file* that contains letters, numbers, symbols and/or a combination. *It enables the creation and storage of text without any special formatting*. Text files are also known as **flat files** or **ASCII files**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A text file is used to *store standard and structured textual data or information that is human readable*. It is defined in several different formats, including the most popular **ASCII** for cross-platform usage, and **ANSI** for Windows-based operating platforms. It lacks *text formatting abilities*, such as *text alignment*, *bold text* and *font styles*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text files characteristics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content:** All content, including every character, will be preserved.\n",
    "- **Context:** N/A. Plain Text does not contain metadata to describe the environment where it was originally created or used.\n",
    "- **Behavior:** N/A. Plain Text does not provide interactive characteristics.\n",
    "- **Structure:** The location of every linebreak will be preserved. There is no other predefined structure for Plain Text.\n",
    "- **Appearance:** N/A. Plain Text does not store appearance attributes such as font (including font size or font style), color, alignment, etc. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Binary File\n",
    "\n",
    "In c, a file is a logical concept that can be applied to many things from disk files to terminals or a printer. A sequence is associated with a specific file by performing a opening. Once the file is open, information can be exchanged between it and the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary file** *is a sequence of bytes that have a one-to-one correspondence with a device\n",
    "external*. So no character translation will take place. Also, the number of bytes written (read)\n",
    "it will be the same as those found on the external device. Examples of these files are Photographs, images,\n",
    "formatted text, executable files (applications), etc.\n",
    "\n",
