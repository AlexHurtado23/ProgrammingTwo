    "*First, before to star with the explanation, is important we know the definition of paradigm so, acording to **RAE** the PARADIGM is:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. m. Example to follow. \n",
    "2. m. Theory or set of theories with a central nucleus that it accept without asking and put the base and model to solve problems and advance in the knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Definitions of Programming Paradigms*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Style of develop of programs.\"\n",
    "2. \"Method of accomplish calculus, structure and organize the task that must do a program.\"\n",
    "3. \"Programming language group that shares the same computational mechanism.\"\n",
    "4. \"Mthod to solve some problem or do some task.\"\n",
    "5. \"It's a documented style, or \"way,\" of programming already fixed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now that we know some about of its definitions, we can follow with the explanation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms. Apart from varieties of programming language there are lots of paradigms to fulfil each and every demand.\n",

    "There exist 2 important classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IMPERATIVE**\n",
    "- **DECLARATIVE**\n",

    "*And each one has its own sub-division, but it's important to that we have very clear those classification to continue.*\n",

    "**IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING PARADIGM**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the oldest programming paradigm. It features close relation relation to machine architecture. It is based on Von Neumann architecture. It works by changing the program state through assignment statements. It performs step by step task by changing state. The main focus is on how to achieve the goal. The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the result is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very simple to implement.\n",
    "- It contains loops, variables etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex problem cannot be solved.\n",
    "- Less efficient and less productive.\n",
    "- Parallel programming is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING PARADIGM**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is divided as Logic, Functional, Database. In computer science the declarative programming is a style of building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its control flow. It often considers programs as theories of some logic.It may simplify writing parallel programs. The focus is on what needs to be done rather how it should be done basically emphasize on what code code is actually doing. It just declare the result we want rather how it has be produced. **This is the only difference between imperative (how to do) and declarative (what to do) programming paradigms**. Getting into deeper we would see logic, functional and database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short, efficient code.\n",
    "- Can be implemented using methods not yet known at the time of programming.\n",
    "- Easy optimization as implementation is controlled by an algorithm.\n",
    "- Maintenance possible independent of application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes hard to understand for external people.\n",
    "- Based on an unfamiliar conceptual model for people (solution state).\n",
    "- Hard to take characteristics of individual applications into account during programming. \n",

    "**Procedural Programming Paradigm**\n",

    "*Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors. A parallel processing system posses many numbers of processor with the objective of running a program in less time by dividing them. This approach seems to be like divide and conquer. Examples are NESL (one of the oldest one) and C/C++ also supports because of some library function.*\n",

    "*It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism. In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem.*\n",

The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation and not the data structure. Data are loosely coupled to functions.The function hide their implementation. Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program. Some of the languages like perl, javascript mostly uses this paradigm.*\n",

A database program is the heart of a business information system and provides file creation, data entry, update, query and reporting functions. There are several programming languages that are developed mostly for database application. For example SQL. It is applied to streams of structured data, for filtering, transforming, aggregating (such as computing statistics), or calling other programs. So it has its own wide application.*\n",
