    "## Classification of programming paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "*First, before to star with the explanation, is important we know the definition of paradigm so, acording to **RAE** the PARADIGM is:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. m. Example to follow. \n",
    "2. m. Theory or set of theories with a central nucleus that it accept without asking and put the base and model to solve problems and advance in the knowledge.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Definitions of Programming Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Style of develop of programs.\"\n",
    "2. \"Method of accomplish calculus, structure and organize the task that must do a program.\"\n",
    "3. \"Programming language group that shares the same computational mechanism.\"\n",
    "4. \"Mthod to solve some problem or do some task.\"\n",
    "5. \"It's a documented style, or \"way,\" of programming already fixed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now that we know some about of its definitions, we can follow with the explanation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms. Apart from varieties of programming language there are lots of paradigms to fulfil each and every demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist 2 important classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IMPERATIVE**\n",
    "- **DECLARATIVE**\n",
    "\n",
    "*And each one has its own sub-division, but it's important to that we have very clear those classification to continue.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING PARADIGM\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the oldest programming paradigm. It features close relation relation to machine architecture. It is based on Von Neumann architecture. It works by changing the program state through assignment statements. It performs step by step task by changing state. The main focus is on how to achieve the goal. The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the result is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very simple to implement.\n",
    "- It contains loops, variables etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex problem cannot be solved.\n",
    "- Less efficient and less productive.\n",
    "- Parallel programming is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING PARADIGM\n",
    "\n",
    "It is divided as Logic, Functional, Database. In computer science the declarative programming is a style of building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its control flow. It often considers programs as theories of some logic.It may simplify writing parallel programs. The focus is on what needs to be done rather how it should be done basically emphasize on what code code is actually doing. It just declare the result we want rather how it has be produced. **This is the only difference between imperative (how to do) and declarative (what to do) programming paradigms**. Getting into deeper we would see logic, functional and database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short, efficient code.\n",
    "- Can be implemented using methods not yet known at the time of programming.\n",
    "- Easy optimization as implementation is controlled by an algorithm.\n",
    "- Maintenance possible independent of application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes hard to understand for external people.\n",
    "- Based on an unfamiliar conceptual model for people (solution state).\n",
    "- Hard to take characteristics of individual applications into account during programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/declarative-programming/\n",
    "\n",
    "*And its sub-division are the following:*\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPERATIVE**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Procedural Programming Paradigm.\n",
    "- Object Oriented Programming Paradigm.\n",
    "- Pararell Processing Approach. \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Procedural Programming Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "*This paradigm emphasizes on procedure in terms of under lying machine model. There is no difference in between procedural and imperative approach. It has the ability to reuse the code and it was boon at that time when it was in use because of its reusability.*\n",

    "\treturn 0; \n",
    "} \n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Oriented Programming Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "*The program is written as a collection of classes and object which are meant for communication. The smallest and basic entity is object and all kind of computation is performed on the objects only. More emphasis is on data rather procedure. It can handle almost all kind of real life problems which are today in scenario.*\n",

    "#### Pararell Processing Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "*Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors. A parallel processing system posses many numbers of processor with the objective of running a program in less time by dividing them. This approach seems to be like divide and conquer. Examples are NESL (one of the oldest one) and C/C++ also supports because of some library function.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It's often the best use when:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have a system that has more than one CPU or multi-core processors which are commonly found on computers today.\n",
    "- You need to solve some computational problems that take hours/days to solve even with the benefit of a more powerful microprocessor.\n",
    "- You work with real-world data that needs more dynamic simulation and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logic Programming Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "*It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism. In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem.*\n",

    "#### Funtional Programming Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "*The functional programming paradigms has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. The key principal of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions. The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation and not the data structure. Data are loosely coupled to functions.The function hide their implementation. Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program. Some of the languages like perl, javascript mostly uses this paradigm.*\n",

    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database Processing Aproach\n",
    "\n",
    "*This programming methodology is based on data and its movement. Program statements are defined by data rather than hard-coding a series of steps. A database program is the heart of a business information system and provides file creation, data entry, update, query and reporting functions. There are several programming languages that are developed mostly for database application. For example SQL. It is applied to streams of structured data, for filtering, transforming, aggregating (such as computing statistics), or calling other programs. So it has its own wide application.*\n",

    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structured Programming Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Structured programming is a kind of imperative programming, focuses on modular programming. It makes extensive use of for, while, subroutines, blocks and sub-blocks, rather than simply using GOTO which leads to complex and tangled code. Structured programming was introduced as an improvement over the imperative programming approach to get more control over the program.*\n",

    "\n",
    "### Programming languages \n",
    "\n",
    "A programming language is *a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Introducccion a la programacion estructurada en C.pdf*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "They are algorithms *that are executed sequentially*, from start to finish, without other processing executing, as opposed to concurrently or in parallel. These algorithms are usually presented as flowcharts and are the most basic algorithms for programmers when they start programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.encyclopedia.com/computing/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/sequential-algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source code\n",
    "\n",
    "Source code is *the list of human-readable instructions that a programmer writes—often in a word processing program—when he is developing a program*. The source code is run through a compiler to turn it into *machine code*, that a computer can understand and execute. Machine code consists primarily of 1s and 0s, so it isn't human-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source code and Machine code are the before and after states of a computer program that is compiled. Programming languages that compile their code include C, C++ or Fortran. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #include<stdio.h>\n",
    "    int main (){\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Identifiers\n",
    "We use them to *name various elements of a program*, such as variables, functions, and arrays. An identifier is made up of *the 27 letters of the alphabet*, including *capital letters*. Also we can use digits *from 0 until 9* and the *underscore (_)*. \n",

    "#### Variables\n",
    "A variable is the *space in memory that we reserve in order to store data*, whether known or unknown. When the execution of the program begins, these may change.\n",
    "\n",
    "To *declare a variable*, it is necessary that we put the data type and its identifier; if we know its value we can initialize it from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Introducccion a la programacion estructurada en C.pdf*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constants\n",
    "A constant is a memory space that is generally reserved for a value that will NEVER change during the execution of the program, it is usually declared in the program header in the following way:\n",

    "\n",
    "A distributed version control system is a type of version control where the complete codebase, including its full version history, is mirrored on every developer's computer. It's abbreviated **DVCS**. A great example of DVCS is **GitHub**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to files are tracked between computers. For example, my workstation and yours. In the beginning, this required specific coordination strategies to maintain consistency in projects, so all the developers could keep track of what was happening to files at any given time. \n",

    "Some benefits of the distribuited version systems are:\n",
    "* Branching and merging can happen automatically and quickly.\n",
    "* Developers have the ability to work offline.\n",
    "* Multiple copies of the software eliminate reliance on a single backup.\n",
    "* The increase in developer productivity.  \n",
