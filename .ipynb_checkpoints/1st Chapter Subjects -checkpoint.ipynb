    "### Programming languages \n",
    "\n",
    "A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "They are algorithms that is executed sequentially – once through, from start to finish, without other processing executing – as opposed to concurrently or in parallel. These algorithms are usually presented as flowcharts and are the most basic algorithms for programmers when they start programming. \n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source code\n",
    "\n",
    "Source code is the list of human-readable instructions that a programmer writes—often in a word processing program—when he is developing a program. The source code is run through a compiler to turn it into machine code, that a computer can understand and execute. Machine code consists primarily of 1s and 0s, so it isn't human-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source code and Machine code are the before and after states of a computer program that is compiled. Programming languages that compile their code include C, C++ or Fortran. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #include<stdio.h>\n",
    "    int main (){\n",
    "    \n",
    "        printf(\"Hello World!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data representatoin in structured programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identifiers\n",
    "We use them to name various elements of a program, such as variables, functions, and arrays. An identifier is made up of the 27 letters of the alphabet, including capital letters. Also we can use digits from 0 until 9 and the underscore (_). \n",
    "\n",
    "The restrictions are that at the first character must be a letter; symbols like #, -, *,  , are not permited. Its recommendable to have clear and simple names as much as posible.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "A variable is the space in memory that we reserve in order to store data, whether known or unknown. When the execution of the program begins, these may change.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a variable, it is necessary that we put the data type and its identifier; if we know its value we can initialize it from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sintax for every type of variable is the next:  ```int Integer = 10;```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constants\n",
    "A constant is a memory space that is generally reserved for a value that will NEVER change during the execution of the program, it is usually declared in the program header in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolic constant: \n",
    "\n",
    "    #define greeting = \"Hello There\";\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #const float Pi = 3.1416;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reserved Words\n",
    "Are words that already have a predeterminated function on the programming language. For example in C we have the following reserved words:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Reserved|words|in|C|\n",
    "|----|------|---|------|\n",
    "|auto|double|int|struct|\n",
    "|break|else|long|switch|\n",

    "#### Types of data, Memory space and Range values\n",

    "|Primitive data type|Description|Memory space|Range value|\n",
    "|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n",
    "|int|It defines an integer value.|2 bytes|-32,767 to 32,768| \n",
    "|char|It keeps a character, can be a value or sign.|1 byte|-128 to 127|\n",
    "|float|It defines a float, number with decimals.|4 bytes|3.4x10^-38 to 3.4x10^38|\n",
    "|double|It defines a float but much bigger.|8 bytes|1.7x10^-308 to 1.7x10^308|\n",

    "|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n",
    "|void|NULL value|0 bytes| NULL|\n",
    "|unsigned char|It keeps a character or value without sign.|1 byte|0 to 255|\n",
    "|unsigned int|It defines an integer value without sign.|2 bytes|0 to 65,535|\n",
    "|short int|It defines an short integer.|2 bytes|-32,767 to 32,768|\n",
    "|long|It defines an iterger but much bigger.|4 bytes|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|\n",
    "|unsigned long|It defines a big integer without sign.|4 bytes|0 to 4,249,967,295|\n",
    "|long double|It increments the size of double.|10 bytes|3.4x10^-4932 to 1.1x10^4932|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data type conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit conversions is known as type casting or, type-conversion. \n",
    "This is done to take advantage of certain features of type hierarchies or type representations. It helps us to compute expressions containing variables of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows:\n",
    "(type_name) expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #include<stdio.h> \n",
    "    int main() \n",
    "    { \n",
    "        double x = 1.2; \n",
    "  \n",
    "        // Explicit conversion from double to int \n",
    "        int sum = (int)x + 1; \n",
    "  \n",
    "        printf(\"sum = %d\", sum); \n",
    "  \n",
    "        return 0; \n",
    "    } \n",
    "output: sum = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "bool -> char -> short int -> int -> unsigned int -> long -> unsigned long -> long long -> unsigned long long -> float -> double -> long double\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #include<stdio.h>\n",
    "    int main()\n",
    "    { \n",
    "        int x = 10;    // integer x \n",
    "        char y = 'a';  // character c\n",
    "  \n",
    "        // y implicitly converted to int. ASCII  \n",
    "        // value of 'a' is 97 \n",
    "        x = x + y; \n",
    "     \n",
    "        // x is implicitly converted to float \n",
    "        float z = x + 1.0; \n",
    "  \n",
    "        printf(\"x = %d, z = %f\", x, z); \n",
    "        return 0; \n",
    "    }\n",

Note that if premise E1 is true, then expression E3 fails to evaluate.\n",

    "### Distributed version control\n",
    "\n",
    "A distributed version control system is a type of version control where the complete codebase, including its full version history, is mirrored on every developer's computer. It's abbreviated DVCS. A great example of DVCS is GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to files are tracked between computers. For example, my workstation and yours. In the beginning, this required specific coordination strategies to maintain consistency in projects, so all the developers could keep track of what was happening to files at any given time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some benefits of the distribuited version systems are:\n",
    "* Branching and merging can happen automatically and quickly.\n",
    "* Developers have the ability to work offline.\n",
    "* Multiple copies of the software eliminate reliance on a single backup.\n",
    "* The increase in developer productivity.  \n",
    "* it makes common activities quick: check in, check out, and commit. \n",
