    "Selective control structures are those that evaluate an expression, usually a Boolean condition, and from the result allow decisions to be made between one, two or more options. This is known as conditional selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 types of structures: simple selection (*If*), double selection (*If-else*) and multiple selection (*Else-if* and *Swich-Case*). The condition can use data of type integer, real or chararcter, and are generally formed using relational operators. For example X <Y or Z == 10.\n",

    "### If \n",

    "The simple selective structure, better known as **If**, is the one that after evaluating an onition determines its value, which is true or false, and only if the result of the condition is true will the instruction or instructions defined by the condition be carried out. It is its sintax: \n",
